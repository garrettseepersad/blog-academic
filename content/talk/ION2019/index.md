title: Assessing the Performance of GNSS Receivers with Legacy and Mass Market State Space Correction Services
event: ION GNSS+ 2019
event_url: https://www.ion.org/gnss/abstracts.cfm?paperID=7790
location: Miami, Florida
summary: "In a rapidly evolving GNSS market, where access to high precision positioning and timing is becoming accessible for mass market applications, the underlying challenge for GNSS users is in the determination of an appropriate correction service for their specific application. Selection of an appropriate GNSS receiver and correction service can become challenging when considering a variety of factors such as network compatibility, correction quality, correction availability, multi-constellation support, latency, bandwidth, power, initialization time, integrity, performance as well as the different business models and distribution channels. GNSS users would prefer a receiver with the capability to facilitate seamless and reliable network integration while satisfying their applicationâ€™s requirements. GNSS correction services message formats generally fall into two categories, based either on the Observation State Representation (OSR) or a State Space Representation (SSR) of the errors. These two representations are used to mitigate key GNSS errors (e.g. satellite orbits, clocks and biases as well as ionospheric and tropospheric delays) in order to enable high precision GNSS performance. Observation Space Representation correction services are supplied by the legacy GNSS correction services providers. The term observation is used because the format is used, for example, to transport pseudorange and carrier phase measurements as recorded by a physical receiver. OSR corrections are also utilised for Network Real Time Kinematic (NRTK) services, where the range measurements are localised for the rover receiver using measurements from receivers in a local network. The downsides for mass-market applications is that dedicated correction generation and high-bandwidth two way communications are necessary for every receiver operating in the network. "

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Academic's [*Slides*](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further talk details can easily be added to this page using *Markdown* and $\rm \LaTeX$ math code.
