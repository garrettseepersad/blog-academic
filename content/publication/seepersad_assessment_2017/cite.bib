	abstract = {Integer ambiguity resolution of carrier-phase measurements from a single receiver can be implemented by applying additional satellite corrections (products) to mitigate unmodelled satellite equipment delays. Interoperability of different PPP-AR products would allow the PPP user to transform independently generated PPP-AR products to obtain multiple fixed solutions of comparable precision and accuracy with limited changes required to user PPP measurement processing software. The ability to provide multiple solutions would increase the reliability of the solution for, e.g., real-time processing; if there were an outage in the generation of one set of PPP-AR products, the user could instantly switch streams to a different provider.},
