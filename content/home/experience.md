A joint project between Gemini Navsoft Technologies Inc. and York University to examine single baseline RTK and PPP for determining long baseline (between 20 and 300 km) for deformation monitoring.

The aim of the project was to address the following questions:

  * How accurate is PPP for baseline determination?
  * What are the benefits of measurement filtering-based RTK over traditional RTK strategies? 
  * When does PPP become a reliable alternative to RTK?
